# 01-HTML-CSS-Code-Refactor-HW

As a marketing agency we want our code to be accessible to a wide array of customers. We also want to simply and make the code easier to read.

## The Changes Made

## HTML 5

- I went in and changed alot of of the div to other semantics. ex. header, nav, section, article, aside, footer.
- I had to add an id tag for the nav bar to be able to link up to the section at the bottom of the page.
- In the HTML file, I combined alot of the elements because they could all be linked together so that CSS can work more smoothly.

### CSS

- Quick note; the less code in CSS the faster the computer can read the code and generate it.
- In CSS, I condensed alot of the code because they multiple section of codes that would go together.
